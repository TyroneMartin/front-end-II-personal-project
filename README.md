# Personal Project: Front End II - Hotel Rate Comparison API

## Description
This project is a personal endeavor for Front End II. Students were required to dedicate a total of 30 hours to build an individual project separate from the group assignment. For my personal project, I built an API using Firebase to host my data. Initially, I attempted to find a free hotel API, but they all required a subscription fee. Since this project was not for commercial purposes, I decided to create one myself.

The project aims to serve a third-party website that aggregates data from other agencies and returns a list of the best prices from partnering agencies. Due to the requirement of dedicating at least 30 hours to this project, I had limited time to fully develop it. However, the core concept remains intact. The project was built using Firebase and Node.js. The API compares third-party rates and provides customers with the best room rates within the USA for a specific area.

I also had difficulty setting up Firebase and securing the connection. To assist future developers, I have included the documentation I found and a sample .env file for easy setup.

## Setup

- `npm install` - Install the necessary dependencies.
- `npm start` - Starts up a local server and updates on any JS or CSS/SCSS changes.

## Generating your API key
- You can also create your own API keys in the Google Cloud console, for example for development or debugging. Learn more about when this might be recommended later on this page.
